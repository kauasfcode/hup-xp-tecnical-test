⚡ Quick Start
✅ Prerequisites

    Docker

    Docker Compose

▶️ Running the Application

To start the entire application stack with a pre-populated database:

docker-compose up

This single command will:

    Build and start all services (backend, frontend, database)

    Automatically populate the database with seed data

    Set up the complete development environment

The application will be ready to use once all containers are running.

🛠️ Development Workflow
🧰 Initial Setup

    Clone the repository

    Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed

    Start all services:

docker-compose up

✏️ Making Changes

    Make your code changes in the respective backend/ or frontend/ directories

    The containers will automatically rebuild as needed

    Run tests to ensure functionality

✅ Testing

    E2E tests are configured for the backend

    Tests run in a containerized environment

    Consistent test data through seeding

⚙️ Services Configuration

The docker-compose.yaml orchestrates multiple services:

    Backend Service: API server with database connectivity

    Frontend Service: Web application interface

    Database Service: Data persistence layer

    Seed Service: Database population utility

🗄️ Database

The application includes automated database seeding that runs on startup, ensuring:

    Consistent development data

    Ready-to-test application state

    Reproducible environments across different setups
